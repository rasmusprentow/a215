\chapter{Group Theory}
\myTop{In this chapter we will explain why the \rubik{} can be considered as a group .}
Group theory is a wide subject, containing many different tools and operations.
Here is a general description of group theory along with a way to represent the \rubik{} as a group.

\myTail{In this chapter the Rubik's cube has been introduced as a group. Some operations which can be applied to the Rubik's cube group have been explained. It has furthermore been proved that a subset of a group is a subgroup, which means that the same theory that applies to a group also applies to a subgroup.}
