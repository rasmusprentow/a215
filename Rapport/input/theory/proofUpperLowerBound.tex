\chapter{Proof of the Upper and Lower Bounds}
\myTop{The upper and lower bound of the \rubik{} will be presented and explained in this chapter. The upper bound needs to be proven, in order for it to be recognized. The lower bound is the bound which we want to find to state that any arbitrary \rubik{} can be solved in this number of twists. NEED REWRITE}

The lower bound is the number of twists required to solve the \rubik{} in the position which requires the most twists to solve.
The upper bound of the \rubik{} is the lowest number of twists needed to solve an arbitrary \rubik{} in the worst case scenario.
Proofs of the upper bound have been published several times, and it has been lowered each time.
A major breakthrough was when Thistlethwaite's algorithm was proven to be able to solve an arbitrary cube in 52 twists or less \cite{jaapthistle}.
Since then a lot of progress has been made in the field.
This section describes this progression.

\myTail{The current upper bound is proven to be 22 twists by Thomas Rokicki using a modified version of Kociemba's optimal solver, solving a set at a time rather than just a single \rubik{}. The upper bound may be lowered in the future, it is however currently difficult due to how much CPU time is needed. The current lower bound has been proven to be 20 twists}
