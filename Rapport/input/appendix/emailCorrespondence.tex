Subject:	Re: Rubik's Cube study at Aalborg University

Hello,

it is quite unusual to give away private informations to some "strangers", but ok, 
here is some information.
I studied mathematics and physics (for "Lehramt an Gymnasien") at the Technische 
Universität Darmstadt http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/ from
1974-1979 and am teacher for mathematics and physics since then at a Gymnasium. I 
still live in Darmstadt. I am interested in Rubik's Cube since the beginning in 
1980 - the same time were personal computers came up - and was immediately 
interested to solve the cube algorithmically. 
But it was not before 1990 that the PC- power was big enough to develop the ideas 
and implementation for the two-phase-algorithm. I used an Atari St with 1 MB of 
main memory for the first implementation and already got average solutions lengths 
of about 21 moves....

If you have some other specific question, let me know.

Best regards

Herbert Kociemba
