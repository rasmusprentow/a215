\chapter{Size of Lookup Table Containing Move Sequences}
\label{chap:sizeOfLookUp}
The size which a lookup table containing move sequences to solving any \cube{} in \m{H} is found by adding the size of every move sequence which is used to solve a \cube{} inside \m{H}.
Since there are 10 move different moves in \m{A}, 4 bits will sufice for a single move.
The size of the entire lookup table will then be:
