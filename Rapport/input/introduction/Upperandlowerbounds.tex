\chapter{The Upper and Lower Bounds}
\label{chap:bounds}
\myTop{In this chapter the process of proving the upper and lower bounds will be described. 
The upper and lower bounds are, as their evolution, essential to this project.}
The lower bound is the number of twists required to solve the \rubik{} in the position which requires the most twists to solve.
The upper bound is the lowest number of twists proven to solve a \rubik{} in any position.

The different bounds throughout the history can be seen on figure \ref{fig:upperLowerBound}.
The upper bound closes in on the lower bound and at some point the two bounds will merge to one \cite{rokicki09}, which is the length of the longest solution of \textit{God's algorithm}.

\begin{comment}
A major breakthrough was when Thistlethwaite's algorithm was proven to be able to solve an arbitrary \rubik{} in 52 twists or less \cite{jaapthistle}.
Since then a lot of progress has been made in the field.
This section describes this progression.
