\section{Problem Limitations}
\label{sec:problemLimitations}
We will only look at the improvements of the upper bound since Thistlewaite proved the upper bound to 52 in 1981\cite{knowledgerush2}.% Only the proof of the latest proved upper bound will be fully described. 

The efficiencies which we wish to test are the \twist{} wise efficiency -- the fewer \twist{}s, the more efficient -- and the time wise efficiency which is simply the amount of time it takes the algorithm to find a solution.
Both of these will be based on a computer solving the \rubik{} since this will give more reliable results.
%The \rubik{} application will primarily be for technical use, meaning that usability will not be in focus.

%Our application must be able to solve a \rubik{} using only operations which are possible on an actual \rubik{}.
%It must also be able to generate a scrambled \rubik{}.
%The application has to be able to present the \rubik{} in a graphical way, but this will not be a primary concern and is considered irrelevant to our problem statement. 

% the details of this will not be covered and it is not considered as an important part of the project.
%Only the part of the theory subjects which relates to our project will be presented. Any full description of a theory subject will be found in our referenced sources.
In the theory part there will not be a full description of the subjects -- only of the aspects related to the \rubik{}.
