\subsection{Magic Puzzle}
\label{sub:magicPuzzle}
The \mpuzzle{} is also known as the 15-puzzle \cite[pp. 48-50]{Larsen81}. It is a puzzle that consists of a tray with 15 square tiles and an empty square arranged in a 4x4 contraption.

It has never been determined who actually invented the \mpuzzle{}, but Samuel Loyd who was an American chess player and puzzle author claimed that he invented the \mpuzzle{} and therefore he got the credit. This claim was rejected by a research of Jerry Slocum. He discovered that there was a wooden version of the puzzle already in 1865 that was manufactured by the Embossing Co. Jerry Slocum searched for the patent and found it, US 50.608, and this patent was applied for by Henry May.

Jerry Slocum also found a patent by Ernest U. Kinsey that was published August 20th 1878. This version by Ernest U. Kinsey was a 6x6 version of the puzzle which also prevented the tiles from being lifted out.

\subsubsection {Permutations}
The tiles in a \mpuzzle{} can in theory be arranged in $16!$ different positions \cite{jaapsch}. This limit can however not be reached because a permutation is needed to switch the tiles. The permutation must be an even or odd number of transpositions depending on where the position of the empty square is.

The tiles are often numbered or labeled with small pictures which -- when assembled correctly -- form a larger picture.
This is related to the \rubik{} because having a solved picture in a \mpuzzle{} is like having a solved \face{} in the \rubik{}.

For instance we got the figure \ref{fig:MagicPuzzle} and want to switch the tiles to be positioned like on figure \ref{fig:MagicPuzzleInverse} \cite[pp. 48-50]{Larsen81}. This permutation requires an odd transposition of the seven pairs (1,15), (2,14), (3,13), (4,12), (5,11), (6,10), and (7,9). This permutation is not possible because it requires an even number of transpositions to get the empty square at the same position. If we color the contraption like a chess board (see figure \ref{fig:Chess}) we can see that every odd transposition makes the empty square change color and with every even transposition the empty square lands on a square of the same color.

Therefore the number of different positions is $\frac{16!}{2}$. If the empty square has to be in a fixed position the possible permutations will be $\frac{15!}{2}$. These permutations are almost like the ones the \rubik{} uses and they actually inspired \erno{} in his creation of the \rubik{} \cite[pp. 7-9]{Rubik87}.
