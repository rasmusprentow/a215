\myTop{It is important to understand what recreational mathematics is in order to get a better understanding of the \rubik{}. The \rubik{} is related to other recreational mathematical puzzles, which have inspired the \rubik{} and are simpler to understand at first grasp. This chapter presents a definition of recreational mathematics and a few examples of recreational mathematical puzzles other than the \rubik{}. Different theorems for these puzzles are presented and proved, because similar proofs are used later for the \rubik{}.}
The \rubik{} under the the topic called recreational mathematics which is a subject of mathematics.
A definition of recreational mathematics is given in the following section.
\section{Definition}
Recreation means to do something which is amusing or relaxing. Mathematics is somewhat harder to give a precise definition of due to the vast amount of subjects that fall under this term.
For the purpose of defining recreational mathematics we define mathematics as:
``\emph{Science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.}''\cite{mathDef2}

Recreational mathematics is hereby defined as problems, puzzles or games involving counting, measuring, or use of shapes which are fun and interesting to laymen as well as mathematicians. \cite{Singmaster98} \cite[p. 18]{Trigg78}
\section{Puzzles}
This project is dedicated to the \rubik{} and the cube will be covered in detail later in this report. This section will instead describe some puzzles related to the \rubik{}.

\myTail{This chapter has given a definition of recreational mathematics and shown three puzzles, which all relates to the \rubik{}; \msquare{}, \mcube{} and \mpuzzle{}. The \msquare{} was the predecessor to \mcube{}, which is in turn the predecessor to the \rubik{}. The permutation from the \mpuzzle{} inspired the creation of \rubik{}, which uses a similar principle for moving the \cpiece{}s around.}
