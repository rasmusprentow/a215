\chapter{Recreational Mathematics}
\label{chap:recreationalMathematics}
\myTop{The \rubik{} is related to other recreational mathematical puzzles, which have inspired to the creation of the \rubik{}.
To better understand the \cube{} this chapter presents its roots.
This chapter presents a definition of recreational mathematics and a few examples of recreational mathematical puzzles related to the \rubik{}.}
\section{Definition}
Recreation means to do something which is amusing or relaxing. Mathematics is somewhat harder to give a precise definition of due to the vast amount of subjects that fall under this term.
For the purpose of defining recreational mathematics we define mathematics as:
``\emph{Science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects.}''\cite{mathDef2}

Recreational mathematics is hereby defined as problems, puzzles or games involving counting, measuring, or use of shapes which are fun and interesting to laymen as well as mathematicians. \cite{Singmaster98} \cite[p. 18]{Trigg78}
\section{Puzzles}
This project is dedicated to the \rubik{} and the cube will be covered in detail later in this report. This section will instead describe some recreational mathematical puzzles related to the \rubik{}.

\myTail{This chapter gives a definition of recreational mathematics and shows three puzzles, which are all related to the \rubik{}; \msquare{}, \mcube{} and \mpuzzle{}. The \msquare{} is the predecessor to the \mcube{}, which is the predecessor to the \rubik{}. The permutation from the \mpuzzle{} inspired the creation of the \rubik{}, which uses a similar principle for moving the \cpiece{}s around.}
