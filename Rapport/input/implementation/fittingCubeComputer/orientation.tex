\section{Orientation}
\label{sec:orientation}
In order to draw a \rubik{} on the screen there are two things which are needed; the position of each \cubie{} and the orientation of each \cubie{}. This section will deal with the orientation of a \cubie{}.

The way to define an edge \cubie{} differs from the way to define a corner \cubie{}, which is why these to are dealt with separately.

In order to define the orientation of a \cubie{} it is needed to define different types of \face{}s, namely three types; primary, secondary, and tertiary. On a \rubik{} there is two \face{}s of each type. Each face of the same type is placed opposite to the other of the type. e.g. the white and yellow \face{}s could be primary because they are opposite to each other, blue and green could then be secondary, and red and orange would then be tertiary.



\subsection{Corner Cubie}
A corner \cubie{} in a given \cubicle{} can ``sit'' in this \cubicle{} in one of three ways. See figure \ref{fig:orientation} for the three different orientations of the white/blue/red corner \cubie{}.
Since each corner \cubie{} has one of each \facelet{} type -- one primary, one secondary, and one tertiary -- the orientation can be defined from where one of these \facelet{}s are positioned.
These different orientations can thereby be defined with an integer between 0 and 2.
0 if the primary \facelet{} of the \cubie{} is on the primary \face{}, 1 if the primary \facelet{} is on the secondary \face{}, and 2 if the primary \facelet{} is on the tertiary \face{}.

\end{figure}

In order to make it easier to draw the \rubik{} a secondary orientation is added. This orientation is defined from which \face{} the secondary \facelet{} is on.
This orientation is also defined from an integer between 0 and 2.
0 if the secondary \facelet{} of the \cubie{} is on the primary \face{}, 1 if the secondary \facelet{} is on the secondary \face{}, and 2 if the secondary \facelet{} is on the tertiary \face{}.
Note that a correctly oriented \cubie{} will have primary orientation 0 and secondary orientation 1.
It will also be easy to define a tertiary orientation of a \cubie{} by where the tertiary \facelet{} is positioned, but this will be redundant since this integer will always have the remaining value, e.g. the primary orientation is 0, the secondary orientation is 1, then the tertiary orientation must be 2.
See figure \ref{fig:orientationFlow} for a flowchart on how to find the primary and/or the secondary orientation of a corner \cubie{}.

\subsection{Edge Cubie}
The orientation of an edge \cubie{} can be defined with a boolean value; either it is correctly oriented or it is not.
This is easiest to see when the \cubie{} is in the right position.
If the white/blue edge \cubie{} is in its correct \cubicle{} then it is correctly oriented if the white \facelet{} is on the white \face{} and the blue \facelet{} is on the blue \face{}.
The \cubie{} is wrongly oriented if the blue \facelet{} is on the white \face{} and the white \facelet{} is on the blue \face{}.

This raises the question: What is the orientation of a \cubie{} which is not in its correct \cubicle{}?
This was not too difficult with corner \cubie{}s because they always had a \facelet{} of each type, which an edge \cubie{} does not. An edge \cubie{} can be one of the following combinations of \facelet{} types: Primary/secondary, primary/tertiary, or secondary/tertiary. With this knowledge it is possible to simply look at the ``highest'' \facelet{}, meaning the \facelet{} with the highest rank.
The rank refers to the type of \facelet{}, where primary is the highest, secondary the second highest rank, and tertiary the lowest.
Then define the orientation as the following: If the highest \facelet{} of a \cubie{} is on the highest \face{}, then the \cubie{} is correctly oriented.
In order to stay in connection with corner \cubie{} the correct orientation of a \cubie{} is given the number 0 and the incorrect orientation the number 1.
Note that this is opposite to what is usually done in programming where 1 is true and 0 is false \cite{boolean2}.
See the flowchart in figure \ref{fig:orientationFlow}.
