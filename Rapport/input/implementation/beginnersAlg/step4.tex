\section{Step -- Orientating the last layer cross}
In the previous steps the algorithms has solved one \cpiece{} at a time. This is not an option for the following algorithms. The algorithms will now look at several \cpiece{}s at the time. 

This step will make the orientation of the top face cross correct. Placing the \cpiece{}s correctly will first be done in the next. This is done by solving
