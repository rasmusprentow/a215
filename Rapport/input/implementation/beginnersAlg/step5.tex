\section{Step 5 -- solving the white cross edge}
In this step the edges of the last layer cross will be positioned correctly. Their orientation will not be changed, since they are already oriented correctly.

The first thing the program needs to know if less than two edges are in their correct position. 
If that is the case the last layer face is rotated clockwise, and the check is performed again. 
We know that either two or all four edges will be oriented by doing the above. 
If all four edges are oriented correctly the method will return, since the step is complete.
If not the program needs to know which two edges are positioned correctly.
If the the two correctly positioned edges are positioned directly across each other algorithm 9 is performed.
The correctly positioned edges are now on two faces next to each other. This is either reaches by algorithm 9 or they were already positioned in this way.
The program checks which two edges are positioned correctly and performs algorithm 9 accordingly. 

The edges are now positioned and oriented correctly.
