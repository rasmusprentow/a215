\section{Step -- Solving last layer orientation}

In the last layer the corners in the last layer were poisitend correctly but not oreiented. In this step will the coreners be oreinted correctly and as result it will lead to that the \rubiks{} will be solved.

This step is very simple because it there is only four corners to control and either the corner is oriented correctly or is isn't.  

The program vil first control that the front-right-up corner is oriented correctly if not the will use the an algorithm twice and after the program vil control the corner again if the corner is not oriented correctly his time the use teh algorithme and will continue with this until the corner is oriented correctly. 
Then the corner is orented correctly the program will make at up move ("U") and will control the new corner and the program will do this with every corner in the last layer until they are oriented corectly.
