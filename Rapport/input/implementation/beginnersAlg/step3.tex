\section{Step 3 -- solving the second layer}

In this step the second layer vil be solved. 

The first question our program needs to ask is that one of the edge pieces already are positioned and oriented correctly in the second layer. If that is the case the program vil proceed to the next edge piece. If the edge piece is oriented incorrectly the program will use an algorithme to move the edge piece up to the top layer and after then use the same algorithme to place the edge piece back into the correctly place and oriented right. 

If the edge piece is not in it's correctly position the program needs to now where the correct edge piece is position. First the program check for it in the top layer
