In this step the corners in the last layer will be positioned correctly.

The initial action performed is a check of the number of correctly positioned corner \cpiece{}s.
The possible cases in this step are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item None of the corner \cubie{}s are positioned correctly.
	\item One corner \cubie{} is positioned correctly.
	\item All corner \cubie{}s are positioned correctly.
\end{enumerate}

If all four corner \cpiece{}s are positioned correctly the program moves on to the next step.
If none of the corners are positioned correctly \vr{algorithm 5aA} is performed. This will position one of the corner \cpiece{}s correctly.
When one corner is positioned correctly the program performs \textit{algorithm 5aA} based on what corner is positioned correctly.
Now the program will perform a check again to see if all the corners are positioned correctly. If all the four corners are not positioned correctly \textit{algorithm 5aA} will be performed again.
When that is done all the four corner \cpiece{}s are positioned correctly and we can move on to the last step.
