\chapter{Choices Prior to Implementation}
\myTop{The choices regarding programming our application of the \rubik{} prior to actually implementing it is presented in this chapter.
This chapter is important to understand the choices which will be made later as well as the actual source code of our application.}
Before we started implementing our application we had to make some choices, namely: Programming language, version control, and how much GUI we wanted.
These choices and the dilemmas we have encountered are presented here.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The first thing we discussed was which language we wanted to write our application in.
We decided that the most important thing was that everyone had a knowledge of the language prior to our implementing phase.
This led us to choose Java as our programming language since every member of the group has been following a course in this language.

	\item Secondly we had to choose a way to share our source code since we wanted to work in smaller subgroups and then collect the work when we completed a task.
To this we chose to use subversion(SVN) because we have all been using this program whilst working on the report and therefore knew how to use it.

	\item Another thing we had to consider was how much time we want to spend on the graphical user interface(GUI) since we do not consider it an important part of our project according to our problem limitations \ref{sec:problemLimitations}.
We chose to make a simple GUI with the \rubik{} in the middle, buttons to right, and a console in the bottom.
The documentation of the GUI is omitted.
\end{itemize}
\myTail{This chapter has presented the choices which we have made before we started our actual implementation.}
