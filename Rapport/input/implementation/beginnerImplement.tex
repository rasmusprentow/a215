\chapter{Beginner's Algorithm}
\myTop{In this chapter the process of implementing the  beginner's algorithm, which was described in the theory part. This implementation will not be as effective as the beginner's algorithm is capable of being. The reason for this is that we only want our implementation to solve the \cube{}, and the number of twists in this algorithm is of low priority.}
This chapter is divided into the different steps used in the beginner's algorithm.
