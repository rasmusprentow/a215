\chapter{Beginner's Algorithm}\label{chap:beginnerImplement}
\myTop{In this chapter the process of implementing the beginner's algorithm, which was described in the theory part, will be presented. This implementation will not be as effective as the beginner's algorithm is capable of being. The reason for this is that we only want our implementation to solve the \rubik{}, and the number of twists in this algorithm is of low priority.}
This chapter is divided into the different steps used in the beginner's algorithm.
Each step is using different algorithms which all are generally structured in the same way. 

For the sake of simplicity the first layer (down face) in our implementation will always be the same face. We have chosen that face to be the yellow face, the green is the front face, and the red is the right face. This will make the implementation process easier, but the solution will require more twists since it is unlikely that the yellow face is the optimal choice as the first layer face for every solve.

\section{Algorithms}
The implementation uses several algorithms which all are named algorithm X, where X is an integer. There are 11 of these and they are all a set of twists that it performs.

Most of them contains a \textbf{switch-case} statement which is dependent on some input specified for each algorithm. In all cases this is based on the point of view. Normally a human will simply rotate the whole \cube{} and perform the same algorithm, but we found it easier simply to define the algorithms from the different locations.

\section{The steps}
In the following the implementation of the steps of the beginners algorithm will be described.
The steps is based on the steps described in section \label{sec:beginner}. With exception of the implementation step five, six, and seven which are the theory step five.

\section{Twist Reduction}
As mentioned before our implementation of the beginner's algorithm is not as efficient as it can be. We can however take some steps towards improving its efficiency. One of these steps is removing unnecessary moves and replacing a move sequence with a shorter move sequence, which gives the same result.

An unnecessary move sequence can be performing a twist and just after that twist perform its inverse move. e.g. performing \m{U U'} or \m{U' U}.
According to the theory of groups in section \ref{sec:groupDefinition}.

It was necessary to be able to shorten the twists generally, so any move sequence can not be replaced with a shorter one in our program.
An example of replacing a move sequence with a shorter one generally is replacing three of the same type of move with a single inverse move of that type. e.g. \m{U U U} also noted as \m{U2 U} or \m{U U2} can be replaced with a single inverse move \m{U'}. This is also described in the group theory section \ref{sec:groupDefinition}.
