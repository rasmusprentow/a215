\chapter{Discussion}
\emptyTop{}
The two algorithms described in this report are very different. 
We will in this chapter describe those differences by using the gathered data from our implementations of them.
The chosen programming language in the implementation and an alternative programming language will be discussed.
%now we want to compare them with each other and see the difference between them. The two algorithms has both been implemented and we will see if they can be improved.  
%This chapter is divided into different issue.
