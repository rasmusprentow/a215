\chapter{Discussion}
%\myTop{In this chapter we will tell about our discussion. There will be told about improvement to the algorithms, comparison between them and other choice in the project.}
\emptyTop{}
The two algorithms described in this report are very different.
In this chapter we will look at some of the differences between them, and also ways to improve them individually. 
There will be looked at the chosen programming language in the implementation and an alternative programming language.

%now we want to compare them with each other and see the difference between them. The two algorithms has both been implemented and we will see if they can be improved.  
%This chapter is divided into different issue.

\section{Improving the Algorithms}
The two algorithms can be improved in several ways. How this can be done will be described in the following.
In order to understand this section it is necessary to have read the general description of the beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver (see chapter \ref{cha:solvingAlgorithms}) and the descriptions of our implementations (see chapter \ref{chap:beginnerImplement} and \ref{chap:kociembaImplement}).

%\myTail{In this chapter the issues of the implementation and the proofs of the upper and lower bounds has been discussed.}
