\section{Another Language}
Java is an interpreted language, and therefore there is some advantages and disadvantages while using it. One of the disadvantages with programs written with an interpreted language is that it is executed much slower compared to direct machine code executions. Java is first compiled to virtual machine code( Java Bytecode) and then it is interpreted to machine code by a runtime application.

The advantage with using a interpeted programming language like Java is, that it is a very safe programming language and it can be executed on all platforms as long the platform hash a runtime application installed. Eg. If the program was made in C++ we would not be able to execute it on all platform.

If we focused our application to only work on one OS (Operating System), eg. Windows, We could write the application in C++. It is a much faster programming language due to the fact that it compiles directly to machine code and this will reduced our solving time.
