\subsection{Kociemba's Algorithm}
Write about the following improvements:

When the cube is solved to H it is possible to look at it from other angels. Secondary as primary and tertiary as primary.
Both the move into H and in H could be saved in a lookup table to increase the speed.
Cloning the cube, to make the program multithreaded.
Running the program on a x64 bit processer has a lot of influence on the program.
