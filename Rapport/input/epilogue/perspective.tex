\section{Improving the Algorithms}
The two algorithms can be improved in several ways. How this can be done will be described in the following.
In order to understand this section it is necessary to have read the general description of the beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver (see chapter \ref{cha:solvingAlgorithms}) and the descriptions of our implementations (see chapter \ref{chap:beginnerImplement} and \ref{chap:kociembaImplement}).
