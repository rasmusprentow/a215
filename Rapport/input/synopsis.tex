The goal of this project is to get a solid understanding of the \rubik{} and create an application which can solve the \rubik{}.
In this report the origin of the \rubik{} will be presented along with some similar puzzles. 
%Its origin will be described along with the general terminology and some underlying theory.
In order get a better understanding of the \rubik{} its construction will be described along with some general terminology. 
Graph and group theory will be described along with an explanation of how these theories can be applied to the \rubik{}.
Because there are many ways to solve a scrambled \rubik{}, there have been chosen two very different solving algorithms.
Their functionality is described along with a description of how these have been implemented.
Finally the difference between these two algorithms will be discussed along with how the implementation can be improved.
