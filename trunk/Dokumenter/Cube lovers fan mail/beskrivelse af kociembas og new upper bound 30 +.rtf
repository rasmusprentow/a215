Subject: an upper bound on god's number\
\
in an earlier message, i promised to pass along any information\
i obtained about progress on the upper bound for the length of\
god's algorithm. \'a0i've received a copy of the article "rubik's\
cube in 42 moves" by hans kloosterman, which i summarize below.\
\
first here are some caveats:\
\
* i haven't verified this algorithm.\
* throughout, `move' refers to any turn of a single face.\
\'a0i don't know what bound is achieved in the quarter-turn metric.\
* it may be the case that this algorithm has been improved.\
\'a0please let me (and cube-lovers) know if you have more information.\
\
\
"rubik's cube in 42 moves" \'a0by \'a0hans kloosterman\
\
the algorithm used here is a slight variant of thistlethwaite's\
algorithm. \'a0we work through a chain of subgroups:\
\
G_0 = < F, B, L, R, U, D > \'a0\'a0( full group )\
\
G_1 = < F2, B2, L, R, U, D >\
\
G_2 = < F2, B2, L2, R2, U, D >\
\
G_3 = subgroup of G_2 in which all U-cubies are in the U face\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0(thus all D-cubies are in the D face and all U-D slice\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0cubies are in the U-D slice)\
\
G_4 = \{ 1 \}.\
\
there are four stages: \'a0stage i reduces our pattern from G_\{i-1\} to G_i.\
\
the indices of the subgroups are:\
\
( G_0 : G_1 ) = 2048 = 2^11\
( G_1 : G_2 ) = 1082565 = 3^9 * 5 * 11\
( G_2 : G_3 ) = 4900 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7^2\
( G_3 : G_4 ) = 3981310 = 2^14 * 3^5\
\
the maximum number of moves in the stages are 7, 10, 8 and 18\
respectively, for a maximum total of 43 moves. \'a0however, in\
the worst-case scenario of stages 3 and 4, it was checked that\
no position actually required 26 moves; i.e. we can arrange a\
cancellation between the two stages. \'a0thus stages 3 and 4\
together require 25 moves at most, which gives the final\
figure of 42 moves.\
\
it seems to me that a lot of work was done on an algorithm\
for restoring the "magic domino" (the 2x3x3 puzzle), and\
these results were applied to stages 3 and 4.\

Subject: Are we approaching God's algorithm?\
\
Because it might interest the readers and to be ahead of Peter Beck:\
Saturday I received CFF (Cubism For Fun) # 28.\
It has an interesting article by Herbert Kociemba from Darmstadt, who\
describes his program to solve Rubik's Cube. \'a0He states that he has not\
yet encountered a configuration that required more than 21 moves. \'a0A short\
description follows:\
\
Basicly the program consists of two stages, based on the groups:\
G0:	[U,D,R,L,F,B]\
G1:	[U,D,R^2,L^2,F^2,B^2]\
G2:	I\
The stages are from G0 to G1 and next from G1 to G2. \'a0Note that the first\
stage is the combination of the first two stages of Thistlethwaite, and\
the last stages combine his last two stages.\
\
His first stage can loosely be described as working in a three dimensional\
coordinate system where the coordinates are resp. twist, flip and permutation.\
He searches his way until the coordinate [0,0,0] is reached. \'a0Most important\
here is that he is able to find multiple ways. \'a0The second stage is similar,\
although he is not very clear here.\
\
He uses lookup tables, but does not tell us how large his lookup tables\
are. \'a0But his program runs on 1 MByte Atari ST. \'a0The heart is coded in\
a few lines of 68k assembly, the remainder in GFA Basic. \'a0As far as I\
know GFA Basic it can be interpreted, but also compiled. \'a0He does also\
use tree pruning.\
\
What he does is find successive solutions in stage 1 and fit solutions\
from stage 2. \'a0Letting the system run longer generally finds shorter\
solutions.\
\
His claims are on average less than 14 turns in stage 1, on average less\
than 10 turns in stage 2. \'a0But according to his article this is not completely\
deterministic, so there is no proven upperbound. \'a0Perhaps a proof can be\
found; I do not know. \'a0In practice he finds an upperbound of 21 moves, which\
is indeed far better than other algorithms do obtain.\
\
To take this in perspective here Thistlethwaites results from Singmaster's book:\
Stage		1	2	3	4\
Proven		7	13	15	17\
Anticipated	7	12	14?	17\
Best Possible	7	10?	13?	15?\
(Are there configurations that require the maxima proven for Thistlethwaites\
algorithm?)\
\
Apparently the combination of stages largely reduces the number of turns\
required.\
\
In CFF 25 there was an article by Hans Kloosterman which did already improve\
on the number of moves. \'a0His stages 1 and 2 are identical to Thistlethwaites,\
he has a third stage that combines the 3rd and 4th stages of Thistlethwaite.\
He reports a proven maximum for his three stages of 7, 10 and 25 moves, so\
slightly better than Thistlethwaites conjectured best figures.\
\
Kociemba's algorithm appears however to be a big leap forward, although there\
are no proofs yet. \'a0One example:\
\
In 1981 Christoph Bandelow wrote a book where he offered a prize for the\
shortest sequence of moves that would flip every edge cuby and twists\
every corner cuby. \'a0The deadline was September 1, 1982; at that time the\
prize was offered for a 23 move manoeuvre. \'a0As Christoph writes:\
	All solutions presented after the main deadline and shorter than\
	all solutions submitted before were also proised a prize. \'a0Using\
	his very ingeneous new search program Herbert Kociemba, Darmstadt,\
	Germany now found:\
		DF^2U'(B^2R^2)^2LB'D'FD^2FB^2UF'LRU^2F'\
	for 20 moves.\
Kociemba himself writes about this:\
	Our first solution had 12 moves in stage 1 and 14 moves in stage 2.\
	In progress solutions 12+13, 12+12 and 12+11 were found. \'a0However,\
	as soon as we introduced manoeuvres of 13 moves in stage 1, we found\
	successively 9, 8 and at last 7 moves for stage 2. \'a0The program was\
	stopped after treating about 3000 solutions.\
He further states that the first solution in general takes 95 seconds, but\
successive solutions take much shorter, and in general he finds one of less\
than 22 moves in a few hours on his 8 MHz Atari.\
\
What is clear is that one does not need the minimal solution in one stage\
to get the minimal overall total.\

does he describe his method of "tree pruning"? \'a0this would seem to\

it's not likely that this will lead to a proof of an effective upper\

kloosterman, but i wouldn't expect him to prove an upper bound\
anywhere near 21. \'a0probably the best bet for this would be to\
exhaustively calculate the diameter of the group \'a0G_1 \'a0(with the\
given generators) and the diameter of the coset space \'a0G_0 / G_1.\
their respective sizes are: \'a019508428800 \'a0and \'a02217093120, \'a0both of\
which are out of my league.\

i believe that the diameters of the respective coset spaces are exactly\
those numbers listed in the "Best Possible" line. \'a0can anyone confirm\
this? \'a0i've finally written a few programs, and those are the diameters\
i get. \'a0i'm surprised that thistlethwaite didn't just do an exhaustive\

very nice. \'a0now how about "superflip," and also "supertwist?" \'a0these\
are also reasonable candidates for antipodes of "START." \'a0i know the\
following manuever for "supertwist" (22 face / 30 quarter turns):\

from the figures i have (111207592 "different" sequences of 7 or fewer\
twists and 167024 "different" sequences of 6 or fewer twists WITHIN G_1)\
it's clear that exhaustive search is too cumbersome. \'a0thus i reiterate\
both my statement that the "tree pruning" algorithm is the essential\
part of this program, and my desire to know more about it (i.e. for\
implementation purposes.)\

\cf3 It has an interesting article by Herbert Kociemba from Darmstadt, who\
describes his program to solve Rubik's Cube. \'a0He states that he has not\
yet encountered a configuration that required more than 21 moves. \'a0A short\
description follows:\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 it would be nice to know how many patterns he has tested.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
He does not say how many, but his article gives nine patterns that have been\
published earlier in CFF for which he finds shorter answers. \'a0Also more are\
promised for future issues.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf3 His first stage can loosely be described as working in a three dimensional\
coordinate system where the coordinates are resp. twist, flip and permutation.\
He searches his way until the coordinate [0,0,0] is reached.\

use tree pruning.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 does he describe his method of "tree pruning"? \'a0this would seem to\
be the "intelligent" part of the program, i.e. recognizing when to\
abandon a given approach. \'a0if anyone has any insight on the tree\
pruning, please let me know.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
I can give some information. \'a0What he does do is calculate in advance through\
the three axis of his space the minimal number of moves needed to get at\
[0,0,0]. \'a0This is used for tree pruning. \'a0It obviously will not prune\
everything (e.g. if you are at point [x,y,z] it may very well be that [x,?,?]\
for other points requires less moves, and similar across the y and z\
direction), but he tells that his pruning is very effective. \'a0I do not know\
how he prunes in the second case, because he does not completely describes\
the coordinates of his second space, but I presume pruning is done in a\
similar way.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 it's not likely that this will lead to a proof of an effective upper\
bound. \'a0perhaps he can shave a few moves off the 42 obtained by\
kloosterman, but i wouldn't expect him to prove an upper bound\
anywhere near 21.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 I think so too. \'a0Moreover, it is difficult to take in account what he\
found, namely that a minimal solution in the first stage does not guarantee\
a minimal overall solution.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 i believe that the diameters of the respective coset spaces are exactly\
those numbers listed in the "Best Possible" line. \'a0can anyone confirm\
this? \'a0i've finally written a few programs, and those are the diameters\
i get. \'a0i'm surprised that thistlethwaite didn't just do an exhaustive\
search on these coset spaces. \'a0perhaps it's just a matter of not having\
the technology when he did his work (~12 years ago).\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 Well, apparently Thistlethwaite did not know that those were the diameters,\
otherwise I have no explanation for the question marks as they appear in\
Singmaster.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
of course, these aren't exactly the patterns to test. \'a0apply your\
favorite quarter turn to either of these patterns, and you're\
one move closer to START.\
\
how do i know that we're one move closer to start? \'a0the patterns\
"superflip," "supertwist" and "superfliptwist" each have the\
following three properties:\
\
1. the group of symmetries of the pattern acts transitively on the\
\'a0\'a0set of "oriented" faces of the cube.\
2. the pattern commutes with the square of each face turn.\
3. the pattern is NOT in the subgroup generated by the squares of\
\'a0\'a0face turns.\
\
now suppose that a pattern with the above properties requires\
N \'a0face turns to return to START. \'a0let \'a0A B C \'a0be a minimal sequence\
of face turns to solve this pattern, where \'a0A, B, \'a0and \'a0C \'a0are\
subsequences such that: \'a0A \'a0consists only of squares of face turns,\
B \'a0is a quarter turn of some face and \'a0C \'a0is the rest of the sequence.\
we can dissect the sequence into these three parts from hypothesis 3.\
from hypothesis 2, the sequences \'a0A B C \'a0and \'a0B C A \'a0have the same\
effect. \'a0finally, from hypothesis 1, the quarter twist \'a0B \'a0may as well\
be our favorite quarter twist.\
\
see the hoey-saxe message on "symmetry and local maxima," for a good\
discussion of this idea. \'a0(in the archives, cube-mail-1, 14 dec 1980)\
\
my apologies if this is obvious to everyone.\
\
on the other hand, the kociemba algorithm isn't completely symmetric.\
thus it may be wise for him to test 2 patterns: "super----" followed\
by \'a0U, \'a0and "super----" followed by \'a0R. \'a0the tradeoff is testing 2\
patterns for being 1 move closer. \'a0i'd say this is probably a good trade.\
\
now to correct something misleading i posted earlier:\
\
) i believe that the diameters of the respective coset spaces are exactly\
) those numbers listed in the "Best Possible" line. \'a0can anyone confirm\
) this? \'a0i've finally written a few programs, and those are the diameters\

\
oops! \'a0i don't mean to say "diameter" here! \'a0these are coset spaces, so\
there's no reason to suppose that (the group of automorphisms of the)\
graph is vertex transitive. \'a0what my programs calculated was the maximal\
distance from the identity coset in each of these spaces. \'a0(i am told\
that the graph theory term is the "eccentricity" of the given vertex.)\

Singmaster states that the diameter of the group for the 2x2x2 cube is not\
known. \'a0I do not know whether it has been calculated in the mean time, so\
I just did calculate it. \'a0The number of elements in the group is\
3,674,160. \'a0(Fix one corner, the others allow every permutation and one\
third of all possible twists.) \'a0The diameter is 11 if we do allow half-turns,\
it is 14 if we do not allow half-turns. \'a0The distribution is:\

\'a0\'a0\'a0623800 with 10 moves\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a02644 with 11 moves\
If we do not allow half-turns:\

In the first case heuristics give a diameter of at least 9. \'a0We see that the\
majority of the configuration is within distance 9 from start. \'a0So it appears\
that heuristics get close to the real value.\
We see also that in both cases there is more than one diametrally opposite\
configuration. \'a0Next I will find out which those are (and if they have\
something in common).\
\
BTW, calculation did not take very long, only a few (<3) minutes on an FPS\
(i.e. \'a0an extremely fast SPARC). \'a0But as the calculations are memory bound\
rather than compute bound, the speed of the processor is not so very important.\

Subject: Kociemba's algorithm\
\
I am now trying to implement Kociemba's algorithm. \'a0The initialization parts\
are done. \'a0To recap, it is a two stage algorithm. \'a0The first stage tries to\
get to the subgroup generated by [R^2,L^2,F^2,B^2,U,D], the second stages\
comes back to start.\
\
The first stage uses a three dimensional coordinate system: twistyness,\
flippancy and choosyness (where are the 4 middle slice edge cubies?).\
The second stage uses (I think) also a three dimensional coordinate system,\
all permutations: corner cubies, edge cubies not on the middle slice, slice\
cubies. \'a0I found the maximal distance along each coordinate as follows:\
\
stage 1:\
twistyness:	6\
flippancy:	7\
choosyness:	4\
This seems not in contradiction with his 10 moves or less on average.\
\
stage 2:\
corners:	13\
edges:		8\
slice edges:	4\
I think this contradicts his 14 moves or less, there are configurations\
that require at least 13 moves to get the corners correct. \'a0I would be\
surprised if only one more move is needed to get everything correct.\
\
*But* some of his best moves use a sub-optimal solution for stage 1!\
Now if that could be quantified...\
\
Next step is implementing the searching algorithms.\

\
I have implemented it based on his description. \'a0I am not yet completely\
satisfied, but can give some results. \'a0Both are the best I found after a\
run of about 30 minutes. \'a0(The numbers are first the number of moves to\
get at [F^2,R^2,B^2,L^2,U,D], second the numbr of moves to complete.)\
\
Superflip:\
(11+10=21): F B R U^2 B^2 U' D' R^2 B' R L U F^2 L^2 D^2 B^2 D' F^2 D L^2 D\
\
Supertwist:\
(7+9=16): F R^2 L^2 U^2 D^2 F^2 B' R^2 U F^2 B^2 R^2 L^2 U^2 D' L^2\
\
So clearly the supertwist is not even close to the opposite of start!\
\
Currently the program needs still a bit of hand-tuning. \'a0I am looking how\
I can improve that.\

Subject: Kociemba's algorithm\
\
I have made my program a bit faster. \'a0While previously the best I found for\
superflip was a 21 move solution (even after 10 hours computation time,\
actually the solution was found after about 30 minutes), I have now a 20\
move solution, found after only 15 minutes:\
\
Superflip:\
(13+7=20): F B U^2 R F^2 R^2 B^2 U' D F U^2 R' L' U B^2 D R^2 U B^2 U\
\
Some more information. \'a0First a short recap. \'a0Phase1 brings the cube in\
the group generated by [F^2,R^2,B^2,L^2,U,D], phase2 brings him back\
to start. \'a0Phase 1 searches in the space generated by the three (orthogonal)\
coordinates:\
Twist (2187 entries), flip (2048 entries) and slice-edge-cube placing (495\
entries).\
Phase 2 searches in the space generated by the three (non-orthogonal)\
coordinates:\
Permutations of corner cubes (40320 entries), permutations of edge cubes\
not in the middle slice (40320 entries) and permutations of the middle\
slice edge cubes (24 entries).\
\
While Kociemba originally did tree pruning based on the minimal number of\
moves needed along single coordinates, I now use pairs of coordinates\
(except that in phase 2 the 40320*40320 pair is not used of course).\
This is part of the speed-up. \'a0(Another part is that I do now disallow\
successive moves of a single face, three or more consecutive moves of\
opposite faces, and a move of an opposite face if the current face moved\
is B, L or D.)\
\
Program details: the program starts with phase1 allowing for succesively\
1, 2 etc. until a maximal number of moves. \'a0As soon as phase1 hits a\
solution phase2 is called, again with a maximum number of moves starting\
at 1. \'a0This means that if the program runs long enough it will ultimately\
find the shortest solutions (phase 1 might just solve it!). \'a0But that wil\
take a long time (of course). \'a0For the superflip, the program has now\
checked all phase1 solutions of upto 12 moves and is busy with 13. \'a0It\
found 792256 solutions of 12 moves (and that in less than 10 minutes)!\
\
Some additional data about minimal paths along coordinates:\
Phase 1:\
twist:		6\
flip:		7\
choice:		5\
twist+flip:	9\
twist+choice:	9\
flip+choice:	9\
\
Phase 2:\
corners:	13\
edges:		8\
slice edges:	4\
corners+slice:	14\
edges+slice:	12\
\
Based on this I expect a maximal distance in phase 1 of about 10/11, and\
in phase 2 of about 16/17.\

Subject: My program is too fast ;-).\
\
I have posted a bit on my version of Kociemba's program, and I can only\
conclude that my program is too fast. \'a0After doing the superfliptwist,\
the superflip and the supertwist I thought about trying those configurations\
where Singmaster's notes did not give a solution better than 21 moves.\
I find now that it takes more time to enter the configurations than what\
the program needs to solve it! \'a0Upto now I found the following (I will not\
give the exact moves, as I think Kociemba wants to publish a bit more about\
this):\
superflip:	20 moves\
supertwist:	16 moves\
superfliptwist:	20 moves\

Subject: kociemba's algorithm\
\
after a long struggle, it appears that i finally have kociemba's\
algorithm working properly, with the improvement that dik mentioned.\
the first pattern i tested was "anaconda" (bandelow's terminology),\
which dik called "walker's worm" (singmaster's terminology?).\
(i think that's the same pattern.) \'a0within 10 minutes, most of which\
was initializing tables, the program produced the following 14 quarter\
turn maneuver, which is better (in the quarter turn metric) than the two\
maneuvers bandelow gives in his book. \'a0here it is:\
\
anaconda: (14 qt) B1 R1 D3 R3 F1 B3 D1 F3 U1 D3 L1 F1 L3 U3.\
\
more results as they come in. \'a0my program isn't quite finished yet;\
hopefully i won't screw it up attempting to improve it.\

\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 The point is that my program deliberately tries short sequences first in\
both phases. \'a0This is at the expense of more work when longer sequences\
are tried (because you will find the shorter sequences again that you\
abort). \'a0The main advantage is that if you find an overall short sequence\
you have much less work to do in the second phase, and can much faster\
abort your searches. \'a0Here some information about the searching for\
superflip (the numbers are for phase 1):\
	Length	Number found	Solutions found\
	\'a0\'a08	\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a00		-\
	\'a0\'a09	\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a00		-\

	\'a012	792256		-\
	\'a013	8695488		13+ 7\
As you see when having the large number of solutions for length 13 in phase 1\
we have only to look at most 7 moves deep in phase 2, and 6 deep as soon as\
we found the solution (which occurs reasonably fast). \'a0That is why it is\
possible to do all that work in about 45 minutes. \'a0(For der Mouse, the machine\
is an FPS. \'a0A SPARC processor twice as fast as a SPARCStation ELC. \'a0But I\
think the program is bounded by memory access time. \'a0The program requires\
about 12 MB memory.) \'a0Now I think the longest distance in phase 1 is about 11\
or 12 (it is at least 11, that is sure). \'a0So in general you will find a\
solution already when there is no need yet to do very much.\

i mentioned these because i was particularly proud of them, especially\
since they were constructed by hand. \'a0my program was able to improve\
"stripes", but i reoriented the pattern first. \'a0perhaps this is why\
i had better success. \'a0stripes (17 face / 20 quarter):\
R1 U1 D1 R2 F1 U3 D1 F3 B1 U3 R3 L3 B1 L2 U1 D3 B2 \'a0(14 + 3)\
so if you have any efficient pattern maneuvers that you're especially\
proud of, let's see if they can't be improved.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf2 I did some more and found fast algorithms. \'a0The most amazing one was for\
the configuration with two 2x2x2 cubes embedded in the cube:\
	( 9+ 6=15): U1 L2 D1 R1 B3 R1 B3 R1 B3 D3 L2 U1 R2 F2 U2\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
this can also be done in 18 quarter turns:\
L1 F1 L1 D3 B1 D1 L2 F2 D3 F3 R1 U3 R3 F2 D1 \'a0(13 + 2)\
also "cube within cube within cube" \'a017 face / 22 quarter turns:\
L3 D1 R3 B3 D1 L2 D2 L3 D3 L1 U1 D2 R3 U3 B2 R2 D3 \'a0(13 + 4)\
"twisted rings" \'a016 face / 18 quarter turns:\
B1 R1 B3 R2 U3 F3 L1 U1 R1 D1 L1 U3 B3 L1 U1 L2 \'a0(14 + 2)\
"twisted cube edges" \'a014 face / 14 quarter turns:\
D1 L3 B1 R1 D3 R3 D1 B3 L1 B1 R3 B3 R1 D3 \'a0(13 + 1)\

\cf2 Leider haben wir nur die Deutschen Ausgabe. \'a0There are apparently\
differences between the German and the English edition. \'a0The English\
edition is later and has probably improved sequences (he has promised\
also improved sequences for the second German edition, but I do not\
think it ever came out).\
\pard\pardeftab720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 \
'tis a shame. \'a0the english edition is very good. \'a0i've never seen the\
german. \'a0in the english edition he gives several "open snakes".\
here's what my program has to say about them.\
"rattlesnake" \'a014 face / 18 quarter turns:\
F3 D3 L1 D3 L2 F1 B2 U1 L3 U3 R3 B2 R1 L2 \'a0(13 + 1)\
"black mamba" \'a014 face / 14 quarter turns:\
L1 U1 R1 F3 R3 L1 U1 L3 U3 D1 B1 D3 L3 U3 \'a0(13 + 1)\
"green mamba" \'a013 face / 14 quarter turns:\
R3 L2 F1 R1 U1 L3 F3 B1 U1 B3 U3 L3 U3 \'a0(12 + 1)\
"boa" \'a012 face / 16 quarter turns:\
D1 R1 F3 R1 L1 F2 R2 D3 L2 F2 L1 F3 \'a0(12 + 0)\

this last one was very nice, since it was completely solved in stage 1!\

i am currently looking for ties, but will soon stop. \'a0this is mainly to\
catch (by eye) maneuvers that are short quarter turn-wise. \'a0i realize\
this is stupid for at least two reasons: \'a01: the program may well be\
passing up sequences which are shorter in quarter turns; \'a02: a slightly\

That was wrong. \'a0It is at least 12 (the superfliptwist needs 12 moves in\
phase 1). \'a0My current conjecture is 12. \'a0Work is in progress, the first\
1,082,565 configurations give the following picture (i.e. all configurations\
without flip):\

\'a07	269388\
\'a08	562427\
\'a09	183730\
10	\'a02668\
The pattern is similar to what was found with the 2x2x2 cube. \'a0The majority\
of configurations requires 2 less than the maximum. \'a0But apparently flips are\
harder to deal with than the rest of phase 1, so I am waiting for more results.\
Note that 12 would improve Kloostermans 42 moves to 37.\

Subject: new upper bound\
\
i've managed to reduce the upper bound for the length of god's\
algorithm to 39 face turns / 56 quarter turns. \'a0we work in three\
stages:\
\
1. from \'a0<U, F, R, L, B, D> \'a0to \'a0<U, R, F>\
2. from \'a0<U, R, F> \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0to \'a0<U, R2, F2>\
3. from \'a0<U, R2, F2> \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0to \'a0START\
\
where we're only allowed to use moves that keep us within the\
given subgroup.\
\
these three stages were chosen because of the moderate(!) sizes\
of the coset spaces that must be considered. \'a0the numbers are\
253440, \'a015676416, \'a0and \'a010886400. \'a0the maximum number of moves\
in each stage was calculated by exhaustively searching the space.\
\
if we count by "face turns," these maximum numbers are 8, 13 and 19.\
however, if we make any turns in stage 2, the last such is a quarter\
turn of either \'a0F \'a0or \'a0R, and the direction is irrelevant. \'a0those\
positions at distance 19 in stage 3 (only 24 in all) were checked\
to see that they may be solved in 19 face turns starting with\
either \'a0F2 \'a0or \'a0R2. \'a0therefore we can arrange to combine the last\
move of stage 2 with the first move of stage 3 in the event that\
we must make the maximal number of moves in each stage. \'a0this\
gives the final figure of 39 face turns.\
\
if we count by "quarter turns," the maximum numbers are 9, 16 and 33.\
this time, those configurations at distance either 32 or 33 in stage 3\
(only 10 and 4 positions, respectively) were tested as above.\
each has minimal sequences starting with \'a0F2 \'a0and with \'a0R2. \'a0as above,\
we may cancel a quarter turn from the end of stage 3 with a quarter\
turn at the beginning of stage 3, to get the final figure of 56\
quarter turns.\
\
the next step is to reduce the figure for stage 3 by allowing other\
turns. \'a0i only plan on allowing \'a0D, U, B2, F2, L2, R2, \'a0as in the\
second stage of kociemba's algorithm. \'a0after that, i may try to reduce\
the numbers for stage 2. \'a0however, in this case, i don't expect much\
of a reduction (maybe 1 turn).\

Subject: New upper bound on God's algorithm for Rubik's cube\
\
Earlier than expected I have gotten my results. \'a0Using a farm of workstations\
I have calculated the distances for all cosets in phase 1 of Kociemba's\
algorithm. \'a0As I have conjectured already, the maximal distance is 12.\
Together with Kloosterman's result for their third and fourth phase (which\
together form Kociemba's second phase) the upperbound on God's algorithm\
is now 37. \'a0Below follows the set of distances for the first phase:\
\'a00: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a01\
\'a01: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a04\
\'a02: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a074\
\'a03: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a01230\
\'a04: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a018056\
\'a05: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0245902\
\'a06: \'a0\'a0\'a03082221\
\'a07: \'a0\'a034529024\
\'a08: \'a0301243996\
\'a09: 1209021801\
10: \'a0663711855\
11: \'a0\'a0\'a05238847\
12: \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0109\
tot: 2217093120\
\
It took quite a bit of computer time. \'a0In all 116 processors in 112 different\
machines have cooperated, although not all at the same time %. \'a0The maximal\
amount of concurrent processing was on 100 processors last night. \'a0The\
distribution was: 69 Sun's (SS 1, SS 1+, SLC, ELC), 40 SGI's, 1 SGI 4D/310VGX,\
5 processors of an SGI 260S compute server and the scalar (SPARC) processor\
of an FPS 500. \'a0I expect it would have taken one or two hours only on a machine\
with 1 GByte of memory. \'a0Calculations on the second phase are still out of\
the question. \'a0Distributing the processing would take much more than 9 times\
as much. \'a0I expect it would take about a day on a machine with 4 GByte of\
memory.\
\
I conjecture that the maximal distance in phase 2 is at most 16. \'a0There is a\
lower bound on it of 14. \'a0This would make the upperbound for God's algorithm 28.\

easy to see: they're the positions obtained from START by the turns\
B, F, L \'a0and \'a0R. \'a0with only 18 different face turns, each should\

the pattern (written in permutation notation) \'a0(FR, FL) (UFL, DFR) is\
at distance 15, so that's (also) a lower bound. \'a0however, if the whole\
cube is turned so that the \'a0F \'a0face becomes the \'a0U face, then the new\

perhaps i should give the figures i obtained when getting my upper\
bound of 39 face / 56 quarter turns in case i also have an error.\
recall the method: we work in three stages:\
\
1. from \'a0<U, F, R, L, B, D> \'a0to \'a0<U, R, F>\
2. from \'a0<U, R, F> \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0to \'a0<U, R2, F2>\
3. from \'a0<U, R2, F2> \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0to \'a0START\
\
where we're only allowed to use moves that keep us within the\
given subgroup. \'a0the number of positions that must be considered\
in each stage are \'a0253440, \'a015676416, \'a0and \'a010886400 respectively.\

Subject: Program bug, and new ideas. \'a0Will they work?\
\
Well, I found the bug. \'a0There was an initialization error which made the\
program think there was a shorter path than there was in a number of cases.\
Alas, as always, the bug did not reveal itself in the test runs I did, it\
was only in the final totals that it was apparent.\
\
The bad thing is that removing the bug increases the compute time considerably,\
because you have in essence to calculate an explicit path for every\
configuration. \'a0I estimate the increase is by a factor of about 3, based on\
some experiments.\
\
The good thing is that it got me thinking about an old idea I had.\
To calculate path lengths to the group generated by [U,D,L2,R2,F2,B2]\
it is irrelevant whether you rotate the complete cube around the U-D\
axis. \'a0Also half turn rotations around the R-L axis are irrelevant.\
And finally, mirroring the cube along the F-R-B-L plane is irrelevant!\
But in most cases this changes twist/flip and position values. \'a0So if\
we look at the twist/flip/position space of 2187*2048*495 cosets we can\
reduce the calculations along one dimension as long as we remember the\
number of representations. \'a0I did some calculations and found that\
2187 can be reduced to 168 or 2048 can be reduced to 219 or 495 can be\
reduced to 45. \'a0Of these obviously the first one is the most fruitful.\
Of course I have to check myself (and anybody who is willing, go ahead).\
Reduction of 2187 to 168 would reduce the total space from 2,217,093,120\
to 170,311,680 calculations. \'a0But then again, dividing the latter figure\
by 4, that could be done in core on a machine with about 50 MByte of memory\
(to calculate path lengths in core only 2 bits per configuration are needed).\
\
I will try around, dik\
