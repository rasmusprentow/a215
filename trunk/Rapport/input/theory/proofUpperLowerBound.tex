\chapter{Proof of the Upper and Lower Bounds}
\myTop{The upper and lower bound of the \rubik{} will be presented and explained in this chapter. The bounds needs to be proven, in order for it to be recognized.}

The lower bound is the number of twists required to solve the \rubik{} in the position which requires the most twists to solve.
The upper bound is the lowest number of twists proven to solve a \rubik{} in any position.
Both bounds can be seen on figure \ref{fig:upperLowerBound}.
As the figure shows, the upper bound closes in on the lower bound.
The graph show that the two lines will converge at some point.

Proofs of the upper bound have been published several times, and it has been lowered each time.
A major breakthrough was when Thistlethwaite's algorithm was proven to be able to solve an arbitrary \rubik{} in 52 twists or less \cite{jaapthistle}.
Since then a lot of progress has been made in the field.
This section describes this progression.

\myTail{The current upper bound is proven to be 22 twists by Thomas Rokicki using a modified version of Kociemba's optimal solver, solving a set at a time rather than just a single \rubik{}. The upper bound may be lowered in the future, it is however currently difficult due to how much CPU time is needed. The current lower bound has been proven to be 20 twists}
