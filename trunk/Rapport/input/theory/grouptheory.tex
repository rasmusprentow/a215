\chapter{Group Theory}
\myTop{In this chapter there will be explained some basic group theory and how it can be applied to the \rubik{}. This is needed because the solving algorithms are based on group theory.}

\myTail{In this chapter the Rubik's Cube has been introduced as a group. Some of the operations that can be applied to the Rubik's Cube group have been explained. It has furthermore been proved that a subset of a group is a subgroup, which means that the same theory that applies to a group also applies to a subgroup.}
