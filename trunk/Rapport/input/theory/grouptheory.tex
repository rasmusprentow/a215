\chapter{Group Theory}
\myTop{In this chapter we will explain group theory and how it can be used to solve the \rubik{}. When we have a good understanding of the group theory we will be able to use it later for our own program.}

\myTail{In this chapter the Rubik's cube has been introduced as a group. Some operations which can be applied to the Rubik's cube group have been explained. It has furthermore been proved that a subset of a group is a subgroup, which means that the same theory that applies to a group also applies to a subgroup.
