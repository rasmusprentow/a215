\chapter{Rubik's Cube Solving Algorithms}
\label{cha:solvingAlgorithms}
\myTop{This chapter will present two different algorithms, which can be used for solving a Rubik's Cube. 
The two algorithms presented here are beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver.
These algorithms will be used as a foundation for the implementation part. }

\myTail{This chapter describes three algorithms, two of the algorithms described in this chapter will be used in the implementation part and the last algorithm where proofed.  
%Two of the algorithms described in this chapter will be used in the implementation part. They have been chosen because of their differences.
