\chapter{Rubik's Cube Solving Algorithms}
\label{cha:solvingAlgorithms}
\myTop{This chapter will present two different algorithms, which can be used for solving a Rubik's Cube. 
The two algorithms presented here are beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver.
These algorithms will be used as a foundation for the implementation part. }
