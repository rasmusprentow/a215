The three algorithms presented here are the beginners algorithm, Kociemba's optimal solver, and the Set solver.
The beginners algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver have been chosen because beginners algorithm is every inefficient with respect to the number of twist but can be performed quite simply \cite{beginner}, where Kociemba's is quite the opposite -- impossible to use for a human solver and extremely efficient with respect to the number of twists. 
Because they are so different it will make a good foundation for the discussion later and this choice agrees with the problem limitations \ref{sec:problemLimitations}. The Set solver is to proof the Upper bound.
