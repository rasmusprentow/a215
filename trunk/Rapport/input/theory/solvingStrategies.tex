\chapter{Solving Strategies}
\myTop{This chapter will present two different algorithms which can be used for solving a Rubik's Cube. These algorithms will be used as a foundation for the implementation part, which makes this chapter essential for the report.}
The two algorithms presented here are the beginners algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver.
These two have been chosen because beginners algorithm is every inefficient with respect to the number of twist but can be performed quite simply \cite{beginner}, where Kociemba's is quite the opposite -- impossible to use for a human solver and extremely efficient with respect to the number of twists.
Because they are so different it will make a good foundation for the discussion later and this choice agrees with the problem limitations \ref{sec:problemLimitations}.
