\section{Kociemba Compared to the Beginners}
The two algorithms implemented in our application differs a lot from each other when looking at efficiency. 
Kociemba is twist-wise efficient but time-wise inefficient while this is opposite, to some extend, for Beginners algorithm. 

Kociemba is the twist-wise optimal solver; it uses less than 22 moves for any positions. 
The time-wise efficiency for Kociemba's optimal solver is not impressive. It is rather inefficient. On a 2,5 GHz Duo Core, it uses in a worst-case scenario approximately 28 million years to solve a \cube{} 18 \twist{}\footnote{Most positions can be solved in 18 \twist{}s \cite{kociemba09}} away from the solved state. With 22 moves away it will use $9.4\cdot{}10^{11}$ years. See appendix \ref{app:kociembaTime} for detailed calculations.   

Beginners algorithm on the other hand, event though not build for any efficiency, uses less than a second to solve 1000 cubes, which probably is sufficient for most applications. 
Twist-wise it is way less efficient since it uses an average of 151 moves to solve any cube (see section \ref{sec:beginnersStat}); where a human speed cuber uses around 60 moves in average \cite{larsPetrus97} \cite{cubeFreak}.
