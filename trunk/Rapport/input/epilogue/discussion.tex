\chapter{Discussion}
%\myTop{In this chapter we will tell about our discussion. There will be told about improvement to the algorithms, comparison between them and other choice in the project.}
\emptyTop{}
The two algorithms described in this report are very different, so in this chapter we will compare the two implemented algorithms.
There will be looked at the chosen programming language in the implementation and an alternative programming language.

%now we want to compare them with each other and see the difference between them. The two algorithms has both been implemented and we will see if they can be improved.  
%This chapter is divided into different issue.

%\myTail{In this chapter the issues of the implementation and the proofs of the upper and lower bounds has been discussed.}
