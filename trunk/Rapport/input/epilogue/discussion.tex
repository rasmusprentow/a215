\chapter{Discussion}
%\myTop{In this chapter we will tell about our discussion. There will be told about improvement to the algorithms, comparison between them and other choice in the project.}
\emptyTop{}
The two algorithms described in this report are very different and will in this chapter be compared to each other and ways of improving them aswell as the programming language used in the implementation will be discussed. 

%now we want to compare them with each other and see the difference between them. The two algorithms has both been implemented and we will see if they can be improved.  
%This chapter is divided into different issue.

\section{Improving the Algorithms}
The two algorithms can be improved in several ways. How this can be done will described in the following.

\myTail{In this chapter the issues of the implementation and the proofs of the upper and lower bounds has been discussed.}
