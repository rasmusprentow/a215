\chapter{Perspective}
\myTop{In this chapter we will look at some ways of improving the two implemented algorithms and the GUI, if the application should go from proof of concept to an finished application.}

\section{General Improvements}
Improving the application from a proof of concept to a finished application our GUI could be improved by making the cube in the application into 3D. Furthermore we could make our application multithreaded, this would give a lot of possibilities. 


\section{Improving the Algorithms}
The two algorithms can be improved in several ways. How this can be done will be described in the following.
In order to understand this section it is necessary to have read the general description of the beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver (see chapter \ref{cha:solvingAlgorithms}) and the descriptions of our implementations (see chapter \ref{chap:beginnerImplement} and \ref{chap:kociembaImplement}).

\myTail{As stated in this chapter there is still room for improvements if we were to finish the application.}
