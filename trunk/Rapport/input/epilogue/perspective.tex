\chapter{Perspective}
In this chapter we will look at some ways of improving the two implemented algorithms if we had more time. 

\section{General Improvements}
If we had more time our GUI could be improved by making the cube in the application 3D. Furthermore could we have made our program multitreading, so that the solving time of our algorithms would be improved.


\section{Improving the Algorithms}
The two algorithms can be improved in several ways. How this can be done will be described in the following.
In order to understand this section it is necessary to have read the general description of the beginner's algorithm and Kociemba's optimal solver (see chapter \ref{cha:solvingAlgorithms}) and the descriptions of our implementations (see chapter \ref{chap:beginnerImplement} and \ref{chap:kociembaImplement}).
