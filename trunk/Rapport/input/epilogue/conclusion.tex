\chapter{Conclusion}
In our project we started to get some knowledge about the \rubik{} and the algorithms used to solve the \rubik{}. We used different communities about the \rubik{} to get the basic knowledge about the \rubik{}. This lead us to our problemstatement:
%\input{problemballs}

To answer our problemstatement we investigated which algorithms there was used to solve the \rubik{}, and we picked two algorithms that where very different to each other. One algorithm was "difficult" and impossible for humans to remember and use to solve the \rubik{} and the other was easy for humans to remember. The "difficult" algorithm is called Kociemba's optimal solver and the easy one for humans is called Beginner's algorithm. We compared these algoritms to see which one was the most efficient twistwise. In addition we investigated the current upper- and lowerbound and how they have been proven.

To get a better understanding of how the moves of the \rubik{} interacts with each other, we had to get an understanding of group theory and graph theory. This information is the foundation of our Terminology.

To compare the two algorithms we implemented them into an application, to illustrate which one was the must efficient twistwise. 

Therefor we came to the conclusion that Kociemba's optimal solver was more efficient twist wise and that the current lowerbound is 20 and the current upperbound is 22 which was proven with the set solver which is a part of kociemba's optimal solver.

\chapter{Perspectivering}
If we had more time we would have optimized our application so the Kociemba's optimal solver can give a solution of a scrambled cube within a forseeable future. In addition we could also look at more algorithms to implement in our application and thereby maybe get a better solution.
