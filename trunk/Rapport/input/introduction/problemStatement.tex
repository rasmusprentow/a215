\chapter{Problem definition}
\section{Problem Statement}
What are the current upper and lower bound of the \rubik{} and how have they been proven? \newline\newline
Which solving algorithms exist and which is the most efficient with respect to the number of twists?\newline\newline
How can we create an application which can solve the \rubik{}?

\section{Problem Limitations}
Because the amount of different algorithms for \rubik{} solving, not every algorithm will be covered in this project.

The \rubik{} solving algorithm will be primarily for technical use, meaning that usability will not be in focus.
