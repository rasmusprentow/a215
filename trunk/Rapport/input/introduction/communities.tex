\chapter{Community}
\textit{The defintion of a cuber?} \\
The Rubik's cube community consist of both a real life community handling competitions and events and a online community where cubers can find the real life competitions, improve their skills and talk together. The majority of the community is focussed on the speed cubing aspect. In the following chapter both the online and offline community will be discussed. Note that the two sides of the community often interfere with each other. 

\section{The online community}
In the world of the Rubik's cube there is a large online community. The community consist of everything from forums and guides to competitions and bragging. Cubers, as they often refer to them selves as, have a place that is the online community to express and compare their abilities, experiences and skills with each other. 

\subsection{Forums}
Forums give the cubers a place for sharing their knowledge and experience\cite{speedsolving.com}\cite{speedcubing.dk}\cite{wca}. Forums or specific Rubik's cube sites allow visitors to find information concerning the cube. The main focus of forums is on how to solve the Rubik's cube or similar puzzles in the least amount of time. Forums are often split into several divisions. Some concerning the hardware used and maintenance techniques for making the Rubik's cube spin with greater ease giving the cuber a slightly better solve time.
A major part is reserved for the theory and the algorithms used to solve the cube -- most of which strive for an efficient solve both in respect to time and number of twists.
Another part of the community is focused on competitions of various kinds. The ``offline'' competitions are held in cooperations with the World Cube Association(WCA) \cite{wca}, which are further discussed in section \ref{sec:wca}. Beside the WCA-competitions some forums hold weekly online competitions where the forum members can upload their solve times for a Rubik's cube or similar puzzles. 

Beside the forums the online community offers a wide variety of sites containing guides, solutions and algorithms for solving the cube. The majority of the Rubik's sites contain the beginner's guide\cite{jasminLee08} whose target group is the beginner who may recently have got their first cube and wants to learn how to solve it. %A search in google for Rubik's cube has 3.38 million hits. 

\section{Competitions}
\label{sec:wca}
Speed cubing competitions are held on a regular basis\cite{wca/competitions}. These competitions have different disciplines for various puzzles related to the original 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. All the official competitions are held in cooperation the World Cube Association (WCA). The WCA governs the official regulations for speed cubing and holds annual world and regional championships. The first World championship in speed cubing was held in 1982 in Budapest, Hungary. WCA governs the official rankings and records for solving the Rubik's cube. In total WCA keeps regulation, ranking and records for 19 different types of competitions. All 19 competitions include puzzles and games which are related to or based on the original Rubik's cube.
