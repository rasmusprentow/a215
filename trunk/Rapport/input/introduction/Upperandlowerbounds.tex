\chapter{The Upper and Lower Bounds}
\myTop{et eller andet}

The lower bound is the number of twists required to solve the \rubik{} in the position which requires the most twists to solve.
The upper bound is the lowest number of twists proven to solve a \rubik{} in any position.
Both bounds can be seen on figure \ref{fig:upperLowerBound}.
As the figure shows, the upper bound closes in on the lower bound.
The graph show that the two lines will converge at some point.

Proofs of the upper bound have been published several times, and it has been lowered each time.
A major breakthrough was when Thistlethwaite's algorithm was proven to be able to solve an arbitrary \rubik{} in 52 twists or less \cite{jaapthistle}.
Since then a lot of progress has been made in the field.
This section describes this progression.
