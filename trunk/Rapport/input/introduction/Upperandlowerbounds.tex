\chapter{The Upper and Lower Bounds}
\myTop{In this chapter we will describe the progress of the upper and lower bound of the \rubik{}.}

The lower bound is the number of twists required to solve the \rubik{} in the position which requires the most twists to solve.
The upper bound is the lowest number of twists proven to solve a \rubik{} in any position.
The different bounds through the history can be seen on figure \ref{fig:upperLowerBound}
%Both bounds can be seen on figure \ref{fig:upperLowerBound}.
As the figure shows, the upper bound closes in on the lower bound and at some point the two bounds will merge to one at some point.
%As the figure shows, the upper bound closes in on the lower bound.
%The graph show that the two lines will converge at some point.

\begin{comment}
A major breakthrough was when Thistlethwaite's algorithm was proven to be able to solve an arbitrary \rubik{} in 52 twists or less \cite{jaapthistle}.
Since then a lot of progress has been made in the field.
This section describes this progression.
