This report is written by seven software engineer students attending Aalborg University, group A215, and is associated with a P2 project in 2010.
The main theme of this semester is ``Network and Algorithms" and our project deals with the \rubik{}.
%The purpose of this project is to obtain a better understanding of how a report is written as a group and what it is like to 
The course of the project was commenced on \myDate{1}{2}{2010}, and the paper was handed in on \myDate{27}{5}{2010}.

Readers are required to have a basic understanding of programming, mathematics, graph and group theory in order to properly understand the contents of the report. 

The report is divided into four parts; Introduction, Theory, Implementation and Discussion. 
Additionally we have produced an application, which is described further in the report and appended on a CD.

All citations are written in square brackets as such [xx]. The number is a reference to the source, which can be found in the bibliography on page \pageref{chap:bib}. 
\rubik{} is a registered trademark, but the trademark symbol is omitted during the report.

All figures are written in long scale.%NOTE: figures betyder tal
