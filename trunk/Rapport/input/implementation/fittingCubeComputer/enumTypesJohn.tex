\section{Positions and Moves}
In order to get a good interpretation of the aspects of the \cube{} the different positions and moves must be defined in an easy accessible way for both humans and computers. We solved this by defining two enumerations class. One containing the possible positions and one defining the possible moves. 

\subsubsection{Moves}
The enumeration class that contains all possible moves actually contains a property for each button in the GUI. Confusing as this might seem it actually saved a lot of time and worked quite well. Of course the permute method of the cube can be called with a button which is not a move and cause an error. This is not a robust program but a proof-of-concept.
