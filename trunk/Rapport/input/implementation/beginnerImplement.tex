\chapter{Beginner's Algorithm}
\myTop{In this chapter the process of implementing the  beginner's algorithm, which was described in the theory part.}
This chapter is divided into the different steps used in the beginner's algorithm.
\section{Step 1 -- the First layer Cross}
For the sake of simplicity the first layer in our implementation will always be the same face. We have chosen that face to be the yellow face, the green is the front face, and the red is the right face. This will make the implementation process easier, but the solution will require more twists since it is unlikely that the yellow face is the optimal choice as the first layer face for every solve.
