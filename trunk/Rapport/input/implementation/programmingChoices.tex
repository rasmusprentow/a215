\chapter{Choices Prior to Implementing}
\myTop{The choices regarding programming our application of the \rubik{} prior to actually implementing it is presented in this chapter.
This chapter is important to understand the choices which will be made later as well as the actual source code of our application.}
The first thing we discussed was which language we wanted to write our application in.
We decided that the most important thing was that every one had a knowledge of the language prior to our implementing phase.
This led us to choose Java as our programming language since every member of the have been following a course in this language.
