\section{Method Solve}

The method \textit{solve} connects all the submethods into one big method that apply Kociemba's algorithm onto the \rubik{}. It start with initializing five variables; a result array which will contain the final move sequence, an integer d which will determine the search depth, an integer l which also is used to determine the search depth, an array b which will contain the move sequence until the \rubik{} enters H and an array c which will be the move sequence after the \rubik{} has entered H. Thereafter it enters a while loop, which initialize an array of moves and permutes the \rubik{} with these everytime the loop runs. After that the method enters a while loop which runs in an endless loop. The permute method applies the moves to the cube. After that it will try solve the \rubik{} from H with the method of the same name, solveFromH, with the parameter l - d.  This will return a result that will be putted in the c array. Thereafter it test if the length d + c's length is lower than the length of l. If that is true  l will be set as the product of d + c size and the result array will be initialized with l. In The result array the move sequence b and the movesequence c is added. after it has tested the length the \rubik{}  permutes the b move sequence back one depth and perform the increaseWithSNotEndingWithA method which will be described in section BLABLA( REF HER!!!!!!!!). After the increaseWithSNotEndingWithA method the program counts the d integer up by one. When the program is unable to find a solution length shorter than the last solution it will return the result array.


\begin{verbatim}
			
			try {
				while (true) {
					try {
						c = solveFromH(l - d);
						if (d + c.length < l) {
							l = d + c.length;
							result = new MoveButtons[l];
							output.addTextln("The solutions of the length " + l + ". The solution is:");
							int j = 0;
							for ( ; j < d; j++) {
								result[j] = b[j];
								output.addText(b[j] + " ");
							}
							for (int k = 0 ; k < c.length; k++,j++) {
								result[j] = c[k];
								output.addText(c[k] + " ");
							}
							output.addTextln("");
							output.addTextln("Time spend: " + ((curTime - startTime)/1000) + " seconds");
						}
					} catch (InvalidCube e) {}
					try {
						Cube.permute(cube, b[d-1].invert());
						b[d-1].invert();
					} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {}
					increaseWithSNotEndingWithA(b, d-1);
				}
			} catch (UnableToIncreaseMoveSequenceException e) {}
			d++;
		}
		return result;
