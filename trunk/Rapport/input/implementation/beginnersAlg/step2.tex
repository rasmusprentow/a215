\section{Step 2 -- completing the first layer}
This step fits the first layer corners into place. The method used for this is very similar to the methods of step 1. 
As with step one the algorithm starts with a specific cube and then try to fit this into place. 
The step is generally described in subsection \ref{sub:step2}.

First it checks whether the cube is already in the right place, if so and it is not correctly orientated an algorithm denoted \textit{algorithm 3} will ``rotate'' this \cpiece{} in its spot until the orientation is correct. 

If the cube is somewhere else in the down layer then an algorithm will move it up to the top layer. 
By now we know that the corner \cpiece{} is either placed correct or is in the white layer. 
The up face will be twisted until the \cpiece{} is placed directly above its correct place. 
Then the same algorithm used to move the cube up will now move it down. 
\textit{Algorithm 3} is then run until the cube is oriented correctly.
