\section{Step 6 -- Positioning the Last Layer Corners}
In this step the corners in the last layer will be positioned correctly. 

The initial action performed is a check of the number of correctly positioned corners. 
If all four corners are positioned correctly the program moves on to the next step.
If none of the corners are positioned correctly algorithm 10 is performed. This will position one of the corners correctly.
When one corner is positioned correctly, then the program will perform algorithm 10 based on what corner is positioned correctly.
Now the program will perform a check again to see if all the corners are positioned correctly. If all the four corners are not positioned correctly algorithm 10 will be performed again.
When that is done all the four corners are positioned correctly and we can move on to the last step.
