\section{Step 3 -- solving the second layer}
In this step the second layer will be solved. 
This means that the edges in the second or middle layer will get placed and orientated correctly. 
In subsection \ref{sub:step3} this is step is generally described. 

The program solve this layer by going through the 4 \cubicle{}s of the second layer and finding and placing the \cpiece{} in its \cubicle{}

If the \cpiece is oriented incorrectly in the correct \cubicle{} the program will use an algorithm to move the edge \cpiece{} to the top layer and move it back to the same position -- but now the orientation will be correct. 

If the edge \cpiece{} is not in it's correctly position the program needs to know where the correct edge piece is positioned. First the program checks for it in the top layer. 
If it is in the top layer up moves are applied to the \rubik{} until the edge piece is positioned in such a way that an algorithm can be applied to move it to it's correct position with the correct orientation. 
If the \cpiece{} is in the second layer but in a wrong \cubicle{}Â the same algorithm used to put it into place will get it out of place.
