\section{Step 5 -- completing the last layer cross}
In the theoretical description of beginners algorithm step five is the implementation steps five, six and seven. 
In this step the edges of the last layer cross will be positioned correctly. Their orientation will not be changed, since they are already oriented correctly. See subsection \ref{sub:step5}.

The four \cpiece{}s in the white layer cross can only be in the four \cubicle{}. This leaves os with essentially two cases. Either all is placed correct or two is placed correct. This requires twisting the up face until one of the cases will appear. 

The program only need to response to the case were two \cpiece{}s is placed correctly. 
If the the two correctly positioned edges are positioned directly across each other \textit{algorithm 9} is performed.
The correctly positioned edge \cpiece{}s are now on two faces next to each other. This is either reached by \textit{algorithm 9} or they were already positioned this way.
The program checks which two edge \cpiece{}s are positioned correctly and performs \textit{algorithm 9} accordingly. 

The edges are now positioned and oriented correctly.
