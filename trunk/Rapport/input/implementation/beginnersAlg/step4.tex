\section{Step 4 --  getting the last layer cross}
In the previous steps the algorithms has solved one \cpiece{} at a time. 
This is not an option for this step. 
Here several \cpiece{}s will be placed at a time. 

This step will make the orientation of the top face cross correct. 
Placing the \cpiece{}s correctly will first be done in the next. 
This is done by checking each case of possible orientation for the edge \cpiece{}s in the top layer. 
There are 3 primary positions where different actions should be taken. See figure \ref{fig:cross}. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item L - shape
\item None is up.
\item A row
\end{enumerate}
It is \textit{algorithm 8} that needs to be performed no matter the case. In case one the algorithm is applied twice, case two the algorithm is applied three times, case 3 the algorithm is applied 1 time.
