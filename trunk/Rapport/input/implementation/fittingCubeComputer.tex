\chapter{Fitting the Rubik's Cube into the computer}
A \rubik{} is a rather complicated 3-dimensional structure and fitting this structure into a computer system is quite complicated. The \rubik{} is build up by 26 cubies held together by each other. This type of structure is not obvious to the computer. If the cube is depicted in the computer in a two-dimensional space the original \rubik{} structure gets even more out of hand. 

A simple way though to handle the \rubik{} in the program is a two dimensional depiction and simply move the \facelet{}s around. But this approach will be far from reality and might not give a re
