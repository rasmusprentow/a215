\subsection{The Cube Class}
The cube class creates the 20 cubicles in which the \cpiece{}s can be positioned. Furthermore the cube class creates the faces and cubies. The class also gives each \cpiece{} its \facelet{}s. The cubies are then put into a face. The cube class creates six faces -- two primary, two secondary and two tertiary faces. Each type of faces are placed opposite to each other. e.g. the up and down faces are both primary.
\subsection{The Face Class}
The Face class takes cubicles from the cube class and position them in a clockwise order. Furthermore the face class takes a facecolor from the cube class and gives it to a face. In addition the face class makes two methods that twist a face clockwise or counterclockwise.
\subsection{The Cubicle}
%MÃ¥ske noget om cubicle class, hvis der bliver lavet noget.
The corner cubicle class creates a cubicle either with or without a corresponding corner \cpiece{}. The edge cubicle class has the same properties, just with an edge cubicle.
\subsection{The Cubie}
The \cpiece{} class sets the orientation correctly by default, and it has functions that return the orientation and \facelet{}s of the \cpiece{}. The corner and edge \cpiece{} classes have functions which return the orientation of the \cpiece{}.
\subsection{The Facelet Class}
The \facelet{} class contains the color of a facelet.
