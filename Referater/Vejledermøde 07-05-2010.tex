\subsection{Problemstatement}

Last bullit - Which algorithms can be used? - Used to what?
Move last bullit up.

Remember ``is'' i used to describe one, ``are'' for plural.

\subsection{Problemanalsys}

Recrational math, choose a desription and stick to that. Close it instead of letting it be open.
Magic square has something to do with magic cube. Make the connetion to rubiks cube fra magic square through magic cube.

Page 9:
Make a referance or change it.

Origin of the cube page 11:
Rette småfejl se Heathers noter.

\subsection{Theory}

Terminology should maybe be moved to the individual sections where it is used.

Missing source to group theory, Anders's notes.
G is underneat *? Should be changed, Anders's notes.

cube is still cubie. Should be spilled out in the terminology.

The kommumative law could be descriebed.

Standardize the terminologies.

Consider what we want to implement and why, this could help making the problemstatement more complete.
More meat on the problemanalsys in the form of why it is interesting to look at the different algorithms.
Do not change them, just give some reasons.

Contact Kociemba about the algorithm.

\subsection{Statusseminar}

Not all needs to get up and talk.
